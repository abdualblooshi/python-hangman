# Hangman

I made this code during a computer science course in university, which is a really good practice to start getting into coding with Python 3
## Getting Started

### Running the code

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/gitanimous/python-hangman.git
```

```bash
  cd python-hangman
```

```bash
  python hangman.py
```
